## Credits

This mod uses lots of code from other mods and receives help from many modders. I really appreciate the open source modding community!
- Thanks to Borgut1337. This mod starts as a patch for Parrying RPG﻿, though ends up with doing something quite different
- Thanks to fenix31415. Parrying -- weapons bounce on impact﻿ provides the original idea
- Thanks to doodlum. I used his code in Simple Weapon Swing Parry - NG﻿ to hook to melee hit event
- Thanks to ThirdEye3301 and Flip from Discord. They taught me how to hook to the frame update, like in Dynamic Gamma SKSE﻿
- Thanks to Shizof and FlyingParticle. I learnt a lot from their open source VR mods
- Thanks to CharmedBaryon for maintaining CommonLibSSE-NG﻿
- Thanks to the SKSE team
